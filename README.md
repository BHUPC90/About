## üç≠ about
BHUPC (Beihua University Project Sharing Organization), as the name suggests, of course, we hope that everyone can share their own projects. It is better to be happy alone than to be happy. We do not ask how well we should do it. As long as you actively join, we are all very happy. Why? To have this organization? We thought about it for a long time.

- The first is to provide a small platform for everyone to share their own projects, so that everyone can learn from each other and share their experiences.

- Second, I also hope that everyone can be humble, because, looking around, there are many people who are stronger than you. As long as they have a positive attitude towards life, we are all welcome~

*tip: Do you think it can only be something related to computers? No, of course not, people who are not in the computer field can also join.*
